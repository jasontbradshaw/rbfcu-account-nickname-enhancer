RBFCU Account Nickname Enhancer
===============================

*Note*: With the re-design of their website, this extension is no longer
functional, and has hence been archived for posterity.

An extension that remembers what nicknames your accounts have, then applies them
in places they don't normally show up for ease of recognition.

# Introduction
If you're an RBFCU member like me and keep several accounts for different
purposes, you've given them nicknames so you know what each one is for.

Sadly, the RBFCU website doesn't actually _show you_ those nicknames everywhere,
most glaringly on the "Manage Scheduled Transfers" page. This leaves you
somewhat in the dark about what the scheduled transfer is doing!

This remembers the nickname associated with each account number, then inserts
them intelligently into places where the RBFUC developers "forgot" to include
them. Now you don't have to be clueless about what each transfer does!

Change Log
----
#### 1.0.0
* Stores nicknames in `localStorage` and shows them on the "Active Transfers"
  page.
